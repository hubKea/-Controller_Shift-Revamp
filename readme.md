# Thinkers Afrika - Shift Report Revamp

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a complete revamp of the Controller Shift Report system for Thinkers Afrika. The goal is to create a modern, secure, and professional web application that replaces the old workflow. The application will allow controllers to create, submit, and manage their shift reports, while reviewers can approve or reject them. A manager role will have full oversight of all activities.

## 2. Core Features & User Roles

* **Controllers**: Can log in, create/edit/submit reports, and view their own report history.
* **Reviewers**: Can view assigned reports, approve, or reject with comments, and generate the final PDF.
* **Managers**: Can view all reports from all users, see approval history, and download any PDF.
* **UI/UX**: The front-end is built with a minimalist, neutral design inspired by Google Stitch, using a professional color palette and layout.
* **Security**: The application uses role-based access control (RBAC) enforced by both client-side logic and server-side Firestore Security Rules.

## 3. Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS

* The final PDF must be of a high, corporate standard with proper margins and layout.
